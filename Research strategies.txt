The way that was most helpful to me, I found, was simply to search up
other people having the same problem. If I understood what the answer
was saying, I'd apply that to my work. It's especially helpful if the 
answerer provided links to the Unity website, so I could check out
exactly what it is that would help me. I tend to get confused and
forgetful of the vocabulary for Unity parts, so while I'm still getting
used to them, this is very handy for me to remember how to do certain 
things.

To further my research strategies, I know that I have access to countless
YouTube tutorials from a decent selection of people who work with Unity.
I was given a list by one of my peers, and I can easily try to find a
tutorial from one of these people if I get stuck on something.
